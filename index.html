      <h1>Biography</h1>
      <p>
        <div>
          My name is <strong>Lin Jing Liu</strong> (Lin Jing is my first name). I am currently a freshman under the College of Engineering at Cornell University. This past June, I graduated from high school, being part of the software engineering major. For the next few years, I intend to pursue a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science. I am excited to learn, explore, contribute, and do any work related to software and computer hardware, such as app development, building websites, and troubleshooting using breadboards. I have already been exposed to these topics through courses I take through my major during high school and through other STEM based programs I was involved in. I am also interested in other STEM related topics, including but not limited to data analysis, statistics, public health, and chemistry. As shown, I am passionate about computer science and other STEM related topics, which impels me to constantly seek for new opportunities related to this field and be involved in them. It is then not surprising that my favorite subjects in school are math, computer science, and science. Overall, as you can observe, I am more of a STEM person, but I do enjoy activities like reading and writing, which offers a different kind of pleasure to me.

          On the other hand, I also have a great interest in STEM-related education. After volunteering and then tutoring elementary school students (primarily immigrants in my neighborhood) in the early years of high school, I develop a passion in tutoring and intend to help more students to achieve success. Starting in the summer of 2020, I begin to assist in classrooms that focus on developing interests in STEM and coding for elementary school students. In the subsequent months, I move to the role of a co-teacher and become a STEM teacher. Through this process, I learn a lot about how to teach and communicate with young students and help them to see how interesting and fun coding can be.

        <h1>Future Goals</h1>
        In the future, I want to become a <strong>software engineer</strong> who create computer programs and develop technologies that have real impacts and address enduring issues in society. For now, I have not decided the specific issues I want to focus on or whether I should initiate something new. I am still learning about computer science and technology and the roles they have in society. Thus, I will say that I am kind of in an exploration zone, waiting to learn more about my passions and to propose more specific goals for the future. But I do have a general goal and am heading toward it with concrete steps.

        <h1>Statement of Originality</h1>
        <div>All information on this website is my original work. I also code the website myself initially using Replit as the Internal Development Environment (IDE) and later using Atom as the editor. Some of the sample works might be completed as class assignments, but they are original in their contents and created by me entirely.</div>
